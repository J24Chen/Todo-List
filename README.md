#Todo-list
A simple todo list that allows users to separate lists into different projects. Included Live Storage to keep user data as long as they are using the same machine.
[Live Preview](https://j24chen.github.io/todo-list/)

## Main Concepts
- Classes, Static UI and objects
- Live Storage


## Constraints
- Refactoring is needed
- Sorting by date is not yet accounted for
  
## Additional Concepts
- Use of other minor libraries through Webpack, such as date_fns for date formatting.

- Webpack.js
- Figma (For Front-end UI design)
- Git/Github
- Visual Studio Code

## On Review
After making such a project with multiple functionalities, I struggled with keeping up with specifics and how it conflicted with my roughly planned design of the website.
Going forward, a whole plan out of the system, targetting how data is held, how different classes and objects communicate and researching main concepts before using them such 
as Live Storage or date_fns will drastically increase the development time of projects.

##Credits
Shout out to the Odin Project and the community for allowing me to research and create this project :)
