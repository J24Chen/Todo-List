Add project to storage,
    - Refresh project list using storage 

Add task to storage
    - Make a separate project storage 






initializeProjectButtons
openProject

loadProjectList
creareProject;


every Button on click MUST HAVE openProject.



NOTES:
addEventListener will NOT create multiple instances if the arguments are 
EXACTLY THE SAME. So using annonymous functions are not recognized as the
SAME and will create a separate event addEventListener.


For tomorrow:
Make a project storage to contain task objects. 
Add function to load tasks

Extra todo 12/9/2024
Make enter key create a project list ONLY if the button has active classList
